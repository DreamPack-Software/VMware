# VMware Workstation 10
VMware Workstation 10 Full is a robust desktop virtualization platform developed by VMware Inc., designed to run multiple x86 and x64 operating systems concurrently on a single physical host. Built on a Type 2 hypervisor architecture, it installs on top of a supported host OS (Windows or Linux) and provides full virtual hardware emulation, including virtual CPUs, memory, storage, network adapters, and graphics support.

Workstation 10 leverages Intel VT-x and AMD-V hardware virtualization extensions to boost performance and enable seamless 64-bit guest OS support. It introduces support for up to 16 virtual CPUs, 64 GB of virtual RAM per VM, USB 3.0 passthrough, and virtual UEFI firmware. Its snapshot and cloning features make it ideal for software development, system testing, and training environments.

The platform also includes advanced virtual networking with bridged, NAT, and host-only modes using virtual switches (VMnet), allowing isolated or connected multi-VM environments. Each VM operates securely in a sandboxed environment, isolated from the host and other VMs.

VMware Workstation 10 marked a significant advancement in desktop virtualization, offering enterprise-grade features in a user-accessible package suitable for developers, IT admins, and testers working with complex OS or network configurations.
